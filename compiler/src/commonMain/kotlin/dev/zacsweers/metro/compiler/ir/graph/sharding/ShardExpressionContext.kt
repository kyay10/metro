/**
 * Context for generating expressions inside a shard or `SwitchingProvider`.
 *
 * When generating initialization code for shard properties, we need to access:
 * - Bound instances on the main graph class (via graphProperty)
 * - Properties in the same shard (via shardThisReceiver)
 * - Properties in other shards (via graphProperty.shardField.property)
 * - Properties on ancestor graphs (via graphProperty.parentGraphProperty chain)
 *
 * For `SwitchingProvider` context ([isSwitchingProvider] = true):
 * - All property access must go through [graphProperty] since SwitchingProvider is a nested class
 *   that holds a reference to the graph/shard, not the graph/shard itself.
 * - [currentShardIndex] should be set to [SWITCHING_PROVIDER_SHARD_INDEX] to indicate this.
 * - For SwitchingProvider inside a shard (not the main graph), [shardGraphProperty] must be set to
 *   provide the extra hop to reach the main graph for cross-shard access.
 *
 * This context provides the receivers needed to generate correct property access paths.
