 * ### Deferrable (breakable) cycles
 *
 * Some DI cycles can be "valid" if at least one edge is wrapped in a deferrable type (e.g.,
 * `Provider`/`Lazy`/ `() -> T`), which means the dependency is resolved on-demand rather than at
 * construction. The [isDeferrable] predicate identifies such edges.
 *
 * ```
 *      ┌────── Provider<A> ──────┐
 *      │     (deferrable edge)   │
 *      ▼                         │

 *   │  A  ├─────────────────►│   B   │
 *   └─────┘                  └───────┘
 *
 *   Tarjan groups A and B into one SCC because of the back-edge B -> A.
 *   findMinimalDeferralSet picks B as the deferral candidate (its outgoing
 *   edge to A is deferrable and that single choice breaks the cycle).
 *   sortVerticesInSCC then ignores the soft edge B -> A and produces:
 *
 *       A, B    (A constructed first; B receives Provider<A>)
 *
 *   The deferred set ends up in `deferredTypes` so codegen knows to emit
 *   a DelegateFactory wrapper for B's view of A.
 * ```
 *
 * If a cycle has **no** deferrable edge, [onCycle] is invoked with the offending vertex list and
 * the caller decides how to surface it (typically a compilation error). If a cycle has deferrable
 * edges but no subset of deferring sources actually breaks it (rare, e.g., multiple interleaved
 * cycles), [onCycle] is also invoked.
 *
 * @param fullAdjacency outgoing‑edge map (every vertex key must be present)
 * @param isDeferrable predicate for "edge may break a cycle"
 * @param onCycle called with the offending cycle if no deferrable edge
 * @param roots optional set of source roots for computing reachability. If null, all keys will be
 *   kept.
 * @param onSortedCycle optional callback reporting (sorted) cycles.

/**
 * Picks the smallest set of vertices in this SCC that, when their deferrable outgoing edges are
 * cut, leaves the remaining graph acyclic.
 *
 * "Minimal" matters because every deferred vertex becomes a `DelegateFactory` in generated code:
 * fewer deferred sources = fewer wrappers = cleaner output and less indirection at runtime.
 *
 * ### Strategy
 *
 * 1. Walk the SCC and build:
 *     - `sccAdjacency` — edges that stay inside the SCC (cross-SCC edges can't contribute to its
 *       internal cycle).
 *     - `deferrableEdgesFrom` — for each vertex, the set of its outgoing deferrable edges.
 *     - `potentialCandidates` — every vertex that has at least one outgoing deferrable edge. Only
 *       these can break the cycle, since deferring a vertex with no deferrable outgoing edge is a
 *       no-op.
 * 2. If there are no candidates, the cycle has no soft edges -> return empty (caller treats this as
 *    a hard cycle).
 * 3. Try each candidate **alone**, in priority order. The first one whose deferral makes the SCC
 *    acyclic wins. Single-vertex deferral is the common case (one `Provider<T>` typically breaks a
 *    2-cycle).
 * 4. If no individual candidate works, try **all candidates together** as a last resort. Some
 *    interleaved cycles need multiple soft cuts.
 * 5. If even that fails, return empty (the available deferrable edges aren't enough to break the
 *    cycle).
 *
 * Candidate priority: implicitly deferrable vertices (e.g. `@AssistedFactory`s, which the user
 * already marked as constructed-on-demand) come first, then natural order. This keeps generated
 * code more stable and prefers obvious-on-the-source choices over arbitrary picks.
 *
 * Cycle-checking is done via [ReusableCycleChecker], which masks the deferred edges during a
 * standard recursive DFS instead of materializing a new adjacency map for each candidate test.
 *
 * Example: `A <-> B` with `B -> A` deferrable (`Provider<A>`):
 * ```
 *   sccAdjacency:        A -> B,  B -> A
 *   deferrableEdgesFrom: B -> {A}
 *   candidates:          {B}
 *
 *   Try {B}: mask B -> A, remaining edge is A -> B -> acyclic. Return {B}.
 * ```

 *
 * ### How it works
 *
 * Tarjan does a single DFS, marking each vertex with two integers:
 * - `index[v]` — the order in which v was first visited (0, 1, 2, …).
 * - `lowlink[v]` — the smallest `index` reachable from v's DFS subtree **without leaving the
 *   current DFS path**.
 *
 * `lowlink[v] == index[v]` precisely when v is the root of an SCC: no descendant could reach an
 * ancestor of v, so everything sitting above v on the SCC stack belongs to v's component.
 *
 * Two stacks are needed:
 * - **DFS stack** — the current call path (`callStack` here, with parallel `edgeCursor` for "which
 *   outgoing edge of v are we up to"). Pops as the DFS unwinds.
 * - **SCC stack** — vertices visited but **not yet assigned to a component**, in DFS-discovery
 *   order (`dfsStack`). When an SCC root finalises, we pop everything down to and including that
 *   root from this stack — those popped vertices form the SCC.
 *
 * The two stacks differ because the SCC stack can hold a long chain across many backtracked DFS
 * frames. In the example above, when we finish processing C's only outgoing edge (`C -> A`), C
 * stays on the SCC stack — C still has no SCC assigned. Only when we finally backtrack all the way
 * to A and find `lowlink[A] == index[A]` do we pop C, D, B, A together as one SCC.
 *
 * Walk-through of the example (edges visited in sorted order):
 * ```
 *  step  action                            index   lowlink  dfsStack          popped
 *  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1     visit A                           A=0     A=0      [A]
 *  2     A->B  visit B                     B=1     B=1      [A,B]
 *  3     B->D  visit D                     D=2     D=2      [A,B,D]
 *  4     D->C  visit C                     C=3     C=3      [A,B,D,C]
 *  5     C->A  (A on stack; back-edge)             C=0      [A,B,D,C]
 *  6     C done; lowlink!=index, don't pop
 *        D inherits lowlink from C                 D=0      [A,B,D,C]
 *  7     D->E  visit E                     E=4     E=4      [A,B,D,C,E]
 *  8     E done; lowlink==index -> pop                      [A,B,D,C]         {E}
 *  9     D done; lowlink!=index, don't pop
 *  10    B inherits                                B=0      [A,B,D,C]
 *  11    A inherits                                A=0      [A,B,D,C]
 *  12    A done; lowlink==index -> pop                      []                {C,D,B,A}
 * ```
 *
 * Result: components = [{E}, {C, D, B, A}] (reverse-topo: sink first, source last).
 *
 * ### Implementation notes
 *
 * Standard Tarjan is recursive. For deep dependency chains (the 1000-module benchmark hits 1000+
 * levels) recursion overflows the JVM stack, so we run an explicit iterative DFS using the
 * `(callStack, edgeCursor)` pair where each frame holds `(v, current edge index)`.
 *
 * Vertices are mapped to dense int ids in sorted order. Adjacency, visited flags, and stacks become
 * primitive `IntArray` / `BooleanArray` / `MutableIntList`s. This is cheaper than per-edge
 * `IrTypeKey.compareTo` / `equals` work that Metro previously used, which then dominated the inner
 * loop.
 *
 * NOTE: The receiver adjacency (both keys and each value set) is assumed to be already sorted. This
 * preserves determinism of the int-id mapping and of the per-vertex edge ordering, so a given input
 * always produces the same output.
 *
 * @param roots Optional set of source roots to walk from. If null, every key in the receiver is
 *   walked (the entire graph is reachable). If provided, only vertices reachable from these roots
 *   are visited; the rest stay [UNVISITED] and are filtered out of
 *   [TarjanResult.reachableAdjacency].
 * @return The list of components (in reverse topological order), the vertex->component-id map, and
 *   the reachable forward/reverse adjacency over visited vertices only.
 * @receiver A directed graph as `vertex -> outgoing edges`. Both the key set and each edge set must
 *   be sorted.
 * @see <a
 *   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan's
 *   algorithm</a>
