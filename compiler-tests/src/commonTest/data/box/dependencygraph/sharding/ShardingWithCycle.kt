// KEYS_PER_GRAPH_SHARD: 2

/*
 * This test verifies that SCCs (cycles) are kept together in the same shard.
 *
 * Graph structure: E → (C ↔ D) → B → A
 * where C and D form a cycle broken by () -> D.
 *
 * C and D MUST stay in the same shard because:
 * 1. They form a strongly connected component (SCC)
 * 2. () -> D needs the actual D instance from the same shard
 *
 * With maxPerShard=2, expected shards:
 * - Shard with A and B (or A alone and B alone)
 * - Shard with C and D together (cycle preserved)
 * - Shard with E
