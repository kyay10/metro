/**
 * A [SuspendProvider] implementation that memoizes the value returned from a delegate
 * [SuspendProvider]. The delegate is released after successful initialization.
 *
 * Modeled after [BaseDoubleCheck], with synchronization provided by a coroutine Mutex.
 *
 * Semantics on all platforms:
 * - Single-flight. One caller runs the initializer and concurrent callers suspend and share its
 *   result.
 * - A failed initialization is not cached. The next caller retries.
 * - Cancellation mid-initialization leaves the cache untouched. The next caller recomputes.
 * - A binding that resolves itself during its own initialization fails fast with a circular
 *   dependency error. The delegate runs with a context marker that is inherited by structured child
 *   coroutines. Independent calls outside that initialization chain still wait normally. Separate
 *   initialization chains can still deadlock if each holds one cache and requests the other.
